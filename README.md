## An Open Invitation to Innovate Together

As you explore Gantt Bot, you'll notice that our code is a work in progress, assembled with speed and exploration in mind. We acknowledge it's not perfectâ€”far from it. But this is more than a project management tool; it's a call to action, a proof of concept designed to inspire. We invite you to look beyond the imperfections, to see the potential and the possibilities that Gantt Bot represents.

Our journey is driven by a singular vision: to demonstrate the untapped value of dynamic and adaptive project scheduling. We believe that by pushing the boundaries of what's expected, we can inspire change across the industry. Our aim is for features like Dynamic Priority Alignment, customizable work types, and the nuanced understanding of resource allocation to become standard facets of project management tools everywhere.

Gantt Bot is not even intended to be it's own project. It's an opportunity for all of us. Whether you're a developer, a project manager, or part of a team that crafts project management software, we extend an open invitation to experiment, to contribute, and to take these ideas forward. If the essence of Gantt Bot inspires just one feature in another tool, we'll consider this mission a success.

## What We Are Doing:
- Automated Scheduling: Automatically assigns tasks based on dependencies, resource availability, and priorities, including handling of partial-time tasks.
- Gantt Chart Visualization: Offers a visual representation of tasks, sub-tasks, dependencies, and project progress.
- Dynamic Task Management: Allows for the creation, editing, deletion, and hierarchical structuring of tasks and sub-tasks with unlimited dependencies.
- Resource Allocation: Enables detailed management of team resources, including custom work ratios and availability overrides.
- Priority System: Features a comprehensive priority system for tasks and resources to guide scheduling decisions.
- Dynamic Priority Alignment (DPA): Integrates with the Program Evaluation and Review Technique (PERT) for adaptive task prioritization based on ongoing project analysis.
- Custom Work Types: Supports user-defined work types for greater flexibility in task categorization.
- Open Source Approach: Plans for open-source development with a focus on community engagement and comprehensive documentation.

## What's Not Normal:
- DPA with PERT Integration: A unique approach to dynamically adjust task priorities, optimizing resource allocation and minimizing delays, not commonly found in standard scheduling tools.
- Para Programming Task Support: Special handling of tasks that require collaborative work efforts, like pair programming, reflecting modern software development practices.
- Flexible Resource Calendars: Beyond typical availability settings, it allows for detailed customization of resource calendars, accommodating exceptions like time off or part-time availabilities.
- Gantt Chart with Advanced Dependencies: Unlike basic Gantt charts, this project emphasizes a deep integration of task dependencies, including sub-tasks and milestones, for precise project tracking.
- User-Defined Work Types and Ratios: Moves away from predefined work categories to allow teams to define their work types and ratios, adapting the tool to various project needs and methodologies.
